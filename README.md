we were trying to do. If you are interested in these things I 
definitly recommed you go check it out https://github.com/ScrappieG/Albion-discord-bot

# about

This bot was created for an albion online guild server. It allows
for easier lootsplits and regears. The bot tracks how much the 
guild owes each member which is super useful if you do things
like regearing people and the guild buying lootsplits.
This is still a work in progress and I will be adding more features
to it. You guys are welcome to use it just gimme some credit thats all
i ask :D.
